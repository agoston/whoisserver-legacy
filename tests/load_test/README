This is the load tester for whois server.

It's a simple application which takes a file containing a query each line,
and feeds it into whoisserver with a definable number of threads. The
threads work very simply: they take the next line of the query file, connect
to the whois server, send them the query, read the answer (they don't care
that it is, it's discarded), then close the connection and start over.

Errors can occur at 2 places: when connecting (connection timeout because of
high load), and when getting the data (because it takes too long for
whoisserver to respond). These are marked in the output.

An extract script is also supplied which takes a whoisserver query log file
as an argument and outputs the queries only on its standard output,
stripping '-k' flags from queries. The latter is needed as outherwise
whoisserver wouldn't close the connection (it would wait for more queries
after serving the first one), resulting in a timeout.

If you have any more questions, check out the source code.
