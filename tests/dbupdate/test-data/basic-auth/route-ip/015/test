# CASE 15: We try to create 20.13.0.0/16 route object. 
#          parent route exists with mnt-by, mnt-lower
#          another parent route exists with mnt-by, mnt-lower
#          password for child and parent mnt-by
%
#
# create route object 
#
# *** THIS TEST WILL FAIL UNLESS WE CHECK BOTH PARENT OBJECTS ***
#
# *** This test is added to the EXCLUDE list as its fix is non-trivial,
# *** requires deep internal changes.
