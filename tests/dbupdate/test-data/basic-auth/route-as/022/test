# route authorisation tests - autnum
# CASE 22: We try to create origin AS200 aut-num object 
#          after a dummy object has been created for it
#          which could happen if a route is created with overrride
#          when the origin of the route does not exist.
#          route, parent exist, origin does not exist.
#          password for child and as-block
%
#
# create aut-num object
