# asn32/as-block tests

# CASE 1: We try to create as-block object
# maintained, using override
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 1: The creation will succeed


# CASE 2: We try to create as-block objects
# all maintained but no override password
# all tests expected to fail on syntax
# so no checks made on auth
#
# create as-block objects
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 2: The creation will fail

# test 2a asdot notation
# test 2b x - y where y>32 bit
# test 2c x - y where x,y > 32 bit
# test 2d -x - y
# test 2e x - -y
# test 2f x - x-1
# test 2g x


# CASE 3: We try create 32bit AS object and query it
# parent as-block object exists
# as a query result, there should be 1 as-block object and 1 aut-num object
#
# create aut-num object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 3: The creation will succeed


# CASE 4: We try create 16bit AS object and query it
# parent object exist
# as a query result, there should be 1 as-block object and 1 aut-num object
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 4: The creation will succeed


# CASE 5: We try create an AS object and query it as AS0.n (without -r)
# parent object exist
# as a query result, there should be no objects found
#
# create aut-num object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 5: The creation will succeed


# CASE 6: We create two as-blocks who are hierarchical to each other and
# try to query smaller one.
# 16 bit
# should return both
# this test is more to document existing behaviour then test anything 
# in particular to make sure 16 bit behaves the same as 32 bit
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 6: The creation will succeed


# CASE 7: We create two as-blocks who are hierarchical to each other and 
# try to query bigger one.
# 16 bit
# should return only bigger block
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 7: The creation will succeed


# CASE 8: We create an AS and try to query this AS.
# Two hierarchical as-blocks exist.
# 16 bit
# 
# create AS object
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 8: The creation will fail

# this test will cause dbupdate to exit with code 20


# CASE 9: We create two as-blocks which are hierarchical to each other 
# and try to query smaller one.
# 32 bit
# should return both
#
# create as-block objects
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 9: The creation will succeed


# CASE 10: We create two as-blocks which are hierarchical to each other
# and try to query bigger one.
# 32 bit
# should return only bigger block
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 10: The creation will succeed


# CASE 11: We create as-block with single asn
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 11: The creation will succeed


# CASE 12: We create two as-blocks which are overlapping each other 
# and try to query one.
# 32 bit
# should return only the one queried
#
# create as-block objects
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 12: The creation will succeed


# CASE 13: We create as-block ranging from 16 bit to 32 bit number
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 13: The creation will succeed


# CASE 14: We create as-block with single as0
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 14: The creation will succeed


# CASE 15: We create as-block with single as4294967295
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 15: The creation will succeed


# CASE 16: We create as-block covering full range
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
