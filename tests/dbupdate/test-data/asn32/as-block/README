# asn32/as-block tests

# CASE 1: We try to create as-block object
# maintained, using override
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 1: The creation will succeed


# CASE 2: We try to create as-block objects
# maintained, using override
#
# syntax errors:
# 0.x anywhere
# x mixed with x.x
# 65536 anywhere
# range x to x-1 <-- this test fails at the moment
#
# create as-block objects
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 2: The creation will fail

# test 2a 0.x - x.x
# test 2b x.x - 0.x
# test 2c x.65536 - x.x
# test 2d 65536.x - x.x
# test 2e x.x - 65536.x
# test 2f x.x - x.65536
# test 2g x - x.x
# test 2h x.x - x
# test 2i x.x - x.x-1


# CASE 3: We try create 32bit AS object and query it
# parent as-block object exists
# as a query result, there should be 1 as-block object and 1 aut-num object
#
# create aut-num object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 3: The creation will succeed


# CASE 4: We try create 16bit AS object and query it
# parent object exist
# as a query result, there should be 1 as-block object and 1 aut-num object
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 4: The creation will succeed


# CASE 5: We try create 16bit AS object and query it as AS0.n (without -r)
# parent object exist
# as a query result, there should be 1 16-bit as-block object and 1 aut-num object
# and maybe some warning that we have converted the query?
#
# create aut-num object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 5: The creation will succeed


# CASE 6: We create two as-blocks who are hierarchical to each other and
# try to query smaller one.
# 16 bit
# should return both
# this test is more to document existing behaviour then test anything 
# in particular to make sure 16 bit behaves the same as 32 bit
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 6: The creation will succeed


# CASE 7: We create two as-blocks who are hierarchical to each other and 
# try to query bigger one.
# 16 bit
# should return only bigger block
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 7: The creation will succeed


# CASE 8: We create an AS and try to query this AS.
# Two hierarchical as-blocks exist.
# 16 bit
# currently FAILS: dbupdate dies because it finds two parent as-block objects.
# 
# create AS object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 8: The creation will succeed


# CASE 9: We create two as-blocks which are hierarchical to each other 
# and try to query smaller one.
# 32 bit
# should return both
#
# create as-block objects
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 9: The creation will succeed


# CASE 10: We create two as-blocks which are hierarchical to each other
# and try to query bigger one.
# 32 bit
# should return only bigger block
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 10: The creation will succeed


# CASE 11: We create 16-bit as-block
# query: -r -B AS0.n - AS0.m
# should return 16-bit block
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 11: The creation will succeed
