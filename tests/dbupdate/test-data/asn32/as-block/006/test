# object tests - as-block
# CASE 6: We create two as-blocks who are hierarchical to each other and try to query smaller one.
# 16 bit
# should return both
# this test is more to document existing behaviour then test anything in particular
# to make sure 16 bit behaves the same as 32 bit
%
% requires initial objects to be loaded
#
# create as-block object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 6: The creation will succeed
