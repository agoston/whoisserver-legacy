# CASE 5: We try create 16bit AS object and query it as AS0.n (without -r)
# parent object exist
# as a query result, there should be 1 16-bit as-block object and 1 aut-num object
# and maybe some warning that we have converted the query?
#
# create aut-num object
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 5: The creation will succeed
