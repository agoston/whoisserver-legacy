# CASE 8: We try to create 2 route objects 
# 20.13.0.0/16,AS200.200 and 20.13.0.0/16,AS200
# member-of is a route-set with as32bit-related name
# member-of is a route-set with as16bit-related name
# which do not exist in db
#
# create route object 
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 8: The creations will fail.
#
# Test used to fail because of bug(zilla) #201 in software
# non existant route-set in member-of defaulted to auth pass
#
# Bug(zilla) #201 has been fixed as a result of not allowing dummy 
# object creations.
# The creations still fail, but because of referential integrity,
# referencing a non existant object.
