# CASE 6: We try to create as-set object AS-TEST
# already referenced by AS123 as member-of:
# THIS TEST ITSELF WILL SUCCEED DUE TO THE BUG, BUT SHOULD FAIL NORMALLY
# will give Error 32 now
#
# This test is faulty to be honest - normally you can't create an
# member-of: without the as-set existing. This only works because
# the loader allows you to do so.
#
% requires initial objects to be loaded
%
# create as-set object
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 6: The creation will fail.
