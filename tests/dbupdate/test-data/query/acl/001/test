# CASE 001: IP denial test
#           set our IP to denied in the ripadmin table,
#           then issue a simple query.
#           Also check denial count increase
#
# NOTE: Our IP is set to 127.0.0.1, so if you're not running
#       the test and the whois server at the same machine, this
#       test will fail!
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 001: The query will fail.
