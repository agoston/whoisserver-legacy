# CASE 005: success/hiararchy traversal test
#           set a hierarchy of enabled/disabled IP ranges in the ACL table
#           then query from the most specific inetnum (localhost, namely) over v6
#           Check whether we get the most specific (enabled) ACL
#
# NOTE: Our IP range is set to ::/41, so if you're not running
#       the test and the whois server at the same machine, this
#       test will fail!
#
#SUCCESS
#
# RESULT 005: The query will succeed.
