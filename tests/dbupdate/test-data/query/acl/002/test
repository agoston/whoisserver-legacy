# CASE 002: range denial test
#           set our IP range to denied in the ripadmin table,
#           then issue a simple query
#           Also check denial count increase
#
# NOTE: Our IP range is set to 127.0.0.1/11, so if you're not running
#       the test and the whois server at the same machine, this
#       test will fail!
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 002: The query will fail.
