# CASE 004: range denial over v6 test
#           set our IP range to denied in the ripadmin table,
#           then issue a simple query over v6
#           Also check denial count increase
#
# NOTE: Our IP range is set to ::/32, so if you're not running
#       the test and the whois server at the same machine, this
#       test will fail!
#
#FAILURE
#
# RESULT 004: The query will fail.
