# CASE 3: We try to modify inet6num object 2001:0658:021A::/48
#         But change the textual representation of the ipv6 address
#         Becasue at the moment the lookup of the existing object fails
#         because of different text representation, dbupdate will try to
#         create it, so it looks up and tries to authenticate against its parent
#         object.
#         That operation fails, but the underlying reason is the above.

% requires initial objects to be loaded

# RESULT 3: The update will succeed
