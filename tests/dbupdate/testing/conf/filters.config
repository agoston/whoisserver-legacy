% This file contains the generic filters which can be used with
% every data set when running the test. This file is processed
% once at the beginning of the test and all filters are stored.
%
% The filter format is as follows:
% filter:   name, single
% ack:      regexp, multiple
% notif:    regexp, multiple
% forw:     regexp, multiple
%
% regexp is ordinaly Perl regexp with some specific extentions.
% see documentation for more details
% 
% If the attrubute is omitted, it will not be checked.
% "filter" is a mandatory attribute, and at least one other
% attribute must be specified to have meaningful filter.
% These syntax checks are performed when filters are parsed.
%
% The filter names can be used in "object" decriptions in
% filters_local.config configuration files for each data set to
% specify the filter in "body" attribute.
% Also custom filters can be defined in these local
% configuration files.
