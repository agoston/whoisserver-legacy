To install the whois-server package, please follow the instructions 
given from the Install.PL file located in this directory.

  $ perl Install.PL --help
  
For older installation instructions and notes about libraries etc,
you can look at the 'INSTALL.bak' file, which is NO LONGER UP TO DATE.


STARTING THE SERVICE (initscripts)
----------------------------------

We have provided a new, revised version of the initscripts. The old
initscripts (whoisd_start and whoisd.server) were replaced with a single
initscript called ripe.whois.

This requires the following directory layout

$BASEDIR
|-- bin
|   |-- whois-server
|   `-- ... (further whois-related binaries like dbupdate)
|-- conf
|   |-- WHOIS-HELP
|   |-- LOOKUP-HELP
|   |-- gdbcomm
|   |-- rip.config
|   |-- sources.config
|   `-- ... (further config files as needed)
`-- var
    |-- locks
    |-- log
    |   |-- ack
    |   |-- audit
    |   |-- dbuperr
    |   |-- forw
    |   |-- mirror
    |   |-- notif
    |   |-- qry
    |   |-- riperr
    |   |-- ripupd
    |   |-- sql
    |   |-- svr
    |   `-- upd
    `-- tmp


Change the BASEDIR variable ripe.whois file to point to your whois basedir,
and copy it to /etc/init.d.

The original directory structure, created by 'make install' is now
deprecated as well.
