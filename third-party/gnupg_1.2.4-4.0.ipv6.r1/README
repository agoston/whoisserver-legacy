The .deb package here is the one we found installed & working on cello.
It is in production now.

I did a search based on the package name, and found the debian repository
called debian-ipv6. However, I couldn't get the sources found in there to
compile - looks like the package is broken in some way. The binary package
however is the exact same as dpkg-repack produced from cello's gnupg
version.

I'll include them here anyway. According to google, only 2 debian-ipv6
repositories exist on the net, so it's probably a good idea to keep this.
