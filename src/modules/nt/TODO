0001 2000/07/25 TODO  Change NT_add_notify_list to accept variable length argument list. 
0002 2000/07/25 TODO  When sending notifications, the AUTO NIC handles must be replaced
                         with assigned ones. Also, the "delete" and "override" attributes
                         must NOT appear in notification messages.
0003 2000/08/01 TODO  Implement NT logging!
0003 2000/08/01 DONE
0004 2000/08/01 TODO  In the NT logs, the time must be printed in the record
                         separators (>>> blabla <<<), after the word "time:"
0005 2000/08/01 TODO  In the notifications $FROM etc must be replaced with their
                         real values.
0006 2000/08/03 TODO  Fix: The forward messages contain wrong info: when an upd is
                         requested, then it reads "deletion requested".
0006 2000/08/03 DONE
0007 2000/08/03 TODO  Fix: In forward messages only the new object must be printed
                        when an upd is requested, not the old object.
0007 2000/08/03 DONE
0008 2000/08/08 TODO  Fix: Forward messages go to unrelated maintainers (when hierarchical
                        authorisation fails, for example, the forward message must go to the
                        mntner mentioned in the mnt-by attribute of related object, but not to the
                        mntner in the mnt-by attribute.
0009 25/08/2000 TODO  Implement NOTISIG string variable in the CA module and print
                        that string in all the notification messages.
0004 26/08/2000 DONE
0010 26/01/2001 TODO  The temp notif files are named after the email address. If the
                        e-mail contains a "/", (which is RFC822 compliant), then
                        it must be replaced with some other char. Tis must be easy
                        since we use a hash to map emails to file names.
0011 19/02/2001 TODO  Multiple notification messages are sent. Fix.
0005 20/02/2001 DONE
0011 22/02/2001 DONE  We now 'unify' the list of e-mail to which we send e-mails.
0012 03/04/2001 TODO  Do the notifications work with networkupdate? Check.
0012 03/04/2001 DONE  Yes, they work.
