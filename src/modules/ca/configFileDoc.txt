The Configuration Module; the Configuration File
================================================

This document describes

- how to add new configuration variables

- how to write the configuration file


The configuration module allows the user to define variables of (currently) 
five basic types: CA_INT (integer), CA_DIRLIST (a directory name), CA_STRING
(any string of text), CA_BOOLEAN (either 0 or 1), CA_SOURCETYPE (defines
a source completely) and CA_ADMIN (defines an administration db).

The variables are called using _get_ and _set_ functions, usually using
the macros defined in the ca_macros.h file.

The "Source" variable is supported by the ca_srcAttribs.h file.

The "Ripadmin" variable is supported by the ca_adminAttribs.h file.


How to add new configuration variables:
======================================

- increment the VARS variable in ca_defs.h

- update your dictionary file (dictionary.txt) with a new line as
  follows
	  <variable name>	<variable symbol> <variable type>

- update the ca_dictSyms.h file 
	 	add the new variable symbol and number

- update the ca_macros.h file
	 	you must use the correct function to get and set your variable
		this depends on the type of your variable (e.g. CA_INT uses the
		ca_get_int() function)

- update the configuration file

	
How to write the Configuration File
-----------------------------------

In general, the format of the Config file for most variables is:

VarName       Value   Qualifier

For the SOURCE variable, it is

SrcName DB-details    Mode    NRTM-details    UpdatePort      Options

each of these values is separated by white-space and

SrcName is the name (a string) of the Source,

DB-details is a comma-separated list of 
host, port, user, password and name of the DB,

Mode is an integer representing the mode of operation of the Source/DB,

NRTM-details is a comma-separated list of
host, port, log directory, delay time and protocol version

UpdatePort indicates which port accepts updates of this source

Options is a comma-separated list of characters describing 
canupd (canupdate: y/n) and deflook (default look-up db: 0/1).
