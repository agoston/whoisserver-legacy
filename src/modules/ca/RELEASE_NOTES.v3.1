V3.0 Beta 1 RELEASE NOTES; CA module
------------------------------------

The big differences between this release and Version 3.0 beta 1 are:

(a) the dictionary of variables is now hard-coded in the file
		ca_dictionary.h;  this file is generated from the file 
	   dictGen.m4 using m4 macros;

(b) the file ca_dictSyms.h is no longer needed; this file contains
    #define statements which map dictionary symbols to integer values;
    this is now done using an enum declaration in the ca_dictionary.h
    file;

(c) variables can now classified as mandatory or optional;  in this
		release, all variables are classified as mandatory;

(d) greater use of the string utility functions from GLib; this fixes a
		problem caused by using fixed size character arrays to store the
		string representation of some of the variables;

(e) the function ca_init() now calls a new function, ca_mandVarChk(); 
    this function checks that all mandatory variables are defined;
    if one or more are not defined, a warning message is printed.  The 
	   total number of undefined variables is also printed.  This function
    returns an integer value which can be used by ca_init() to halt the
    start-up of the server.
