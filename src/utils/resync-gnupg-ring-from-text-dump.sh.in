#  grab the GPG keys from the key-cert objects in the text dump and feed them to
#  GPG to re-create the local key ring
#
#  EG 20020424
#
# This requires the use of --ignore-crc-error option
# The option is needed because some keys couldn't be imported
# for CRC errors, but actually they aren't wrong, it's only the fault
# of bad mailers.
