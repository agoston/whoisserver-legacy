These files contain the classes, attributes, and syntax definitions used
in RIP.  The XML (and associated DTD) files define the syntax and
semantics of the RPSL, as well as containing SQL instructions to query
and modify the database's representation of these.

These files define the format that the XML files must take:

syntax.dtd
attributes.dtd
classes.dtd

These XML files actually contain definitions:

syntax.xml         - Syntax rules
attributes.xml     - Attribute definitions
classes.xml        - Class definitions
*.[ly]             - Lex/Yacc source used by some some syntax rules.

These files are copied from the appropriate variants subdirectory by
the build.sh script used to install the software.

Java classes are used to convert the XML into *.def and *_tab.h files
used by the RIP code.

Defs.java             - The main program.
AttributeDef.java     - Attribute definitions.
ClassDef.java         - Class definitions.
Query.java            - Query definitions.
RPSLSyntax.java       - Contains a set of syntax definitions.
AttributeSyntax.java  - Syntax definitions.
