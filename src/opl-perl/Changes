 -- Library renamed to Net::Whois::RIPE::RPSL
 -- Leak tests were failing on Solaris because of 4 bytes difference, added a tolerance value to deal with this.

 Portability fixes:

 -- Makefile.PL now searches for `ar' (on Solaris it used to live in /usr/ccs/bin)
 -- mem() subroutine was moved out of test scripts into mem.pl
 -- linux-specific options for `ps' changed in order to be understood by Solaris `ps' as well


 20020805 Peter Banik <peter@ripe.net>

 Updated XS code with new routines in librpsl.
 
 -- Added RPSL::get_classes()
 -- Added RPSL::TemplateAttribute subclass
 -- Added RPSL::get_template()
 -- Added RPSL::Attribute::attr_get_clean_lines()

 In order to get RPSL::get_template() being able to return the template as a
 hash reference, this module will need the Tie::IxHash module, which is available
 from CPAN:
