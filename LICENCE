Users of this software should be aware that the RIPE NCC is not a software 
vendor. We do not supply software packages that are expected to 'work out 
of the box'. We do not test our software on multiple platforms. We may, at 
our discretion, supply limited technical documentation or technical support.

You accept this software on an 'as is' basis and use it at your own risk. 
The RIPE NCC makes no claims about the suitability of this software for any 
purpose other than our own use of it to operate the public RIPE Database 
service. User documentation and support available from our web site 
(www.ripe.net) and through the Customer Services department of the RIPE NCC 
is intended to assist users of our implementation of this software for the 
public services we operate.

In no event will the RIPE NCC, or any other party who may modify and/or 
redistribute this software, be liable to you for damages, including any 
general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use 
or inability to use this software (including but not limited to loss of data 
or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties 
or a failure of the software to operate with any other programs), even if you 
or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Use of our software requires a high level of technical knowledge. The RIPE NCC 
technical groups will attempt to answer individual technical questions on a 
'best effort' basis. This is always subject to our work load and availability 
of staff. We do not guarantee to provide answers or imply any time frame for 
when answers may be available.

All such questions should be sent to our Customer Services Department who can 
be contacted at <ripe-dbm@ripe.net>. They will log the requests and forward 
them to the appropriate technical group. Individual staff members of the RIPE 
NCC will not respond to direct approaches for support. 

We always welcome constructive comments and bug reports regarding any aspect 
of our software in it's use by the RIPE NCC to operate our public services. 
These should also be sent to our Customer Services Department.
