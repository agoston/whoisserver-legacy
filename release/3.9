20101008 - version 3.9

Changes:
Radix interface is exposed. Listening on the SVLOOKUP_PORT, it interprets
queries in similar format as the whois queries, and runs them against the
radix trees, returning object_id and pkey of the matching nodes.

It is designed to be used internally, so that external software can use
the radix trees for its own functions directly.


Merged:
- radix_expose
- bug_status_change
- numerous minor bugfixes and feature enhancements backported from
strong_reg


Installation notes:
- Because the lookup port has been introduced, you will need to adjust
your configuration files.

- The lookup port is strictly RIPE NCC-internal only. It is not an interface
for external users, but for other internal RIPE NCC services.


Affected stakeholders:
- NCC Services WG
- DB WG
