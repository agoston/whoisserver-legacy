20080626 - version 3.4.2

Changes:
- Changed sender of forward emails to unread@ripe.net
- Removed Reply-to: field from notification and forward messages
- Some tidying up of the text in notification and forward messages
- Some compressing of excessive blank lines between paragraphs in
  these messages.

Merged:
- feature-denis-notification_mail_loop2


Affected stakeholders:
 - Any user who parses the text in the notification or forward message.
   (Note the user does not see these as different message types. To the user they are both 
   notification messages.)
   The changes are only to the e-mail addresses and the information text at the start of the 
   notification.
   Any user who parses the notification text sensibly to find information about what has
   changed will not be affected.
   Internally and externally, anyone who filters e-mail on the From: field.
