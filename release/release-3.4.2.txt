20080729 - version 3.4.2

Changes:
- Did all the changes (including bugfixes) to make whoisserver compile and run
  on:
   - 64bit OS
   - debian etch
   - mysql5

- Added libxml and libxslt sources, as whoisserver is depending on a
  specific version of these libraries

- Made libxml and libxslt link statically to dbupdate to avoid any chance of
  accidental dynamic linking to the system libraries


Merged:
- bugfix-agoston-etch64bit


Affected stakeholders:
- None (no externally visible changes)
