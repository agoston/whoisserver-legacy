20101008 - version 3.9

Changes:



Merged:
- radix_expose (thanks to Gary Kenedy from APNIC)
- bug_status_change
- numerous minor bugfixes and feature enhancements backported


Installation notes:
- Because the lookup port has been introduced, you will need to adjust
your configuration files.

- The lookup port is strictly RIPE NCC-internal only. It is not an interface
for external users, but for other internal RIPE NCC services.


Affected stakeholders:
- NCC Services WG
- DB WG
