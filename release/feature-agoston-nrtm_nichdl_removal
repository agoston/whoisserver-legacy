- Changed dummification procedure to better reflect data protection laws
- Introduced NRTM version 3
- ... FIXME: during review some more details could be added, as there were a
lot of smaller, out-of-scope changes!

Installation notes:
- Change nrtm version from 2 to 3 during installation to make use of the new
nrtm protocol
