BUGS:
- nrtm client has a design problem when replicating from a v3 client! it is
because, for some reason, nrtm client does a delete/add operation on every
modify, thus serials get out of sync, etc... This should be investigated and
fixed before even thinking about a release!


---

- Changed dummification procedure to better reflect data protection laws
- Introduced NRTM version 3
- ... FIXME: during review some more details could be added, as there were a
lot of smaller, out-of-scope changes!

Installation notes:
- Change nrtm version from 2 to 3 during installation to make use of the new
nrtm protocol
