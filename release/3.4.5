Merged:
- feature-denis-White_pages
- feature-denis-notification_mail_loop2


Affected stakeholders:
- Any user who parses the text in the notification or forward message. 
   (Note the user does not see these as different message types. To the user
   they are both notification messages.) The changes are only to the e-mail
   addresses and the information text at the start of the notification.

- Any user who parses the notification text sensibly to find information
   about what has changed will not be affected.

- Internally and externally, anyone who filters e-mail on the From: field.
- The improved error reporting will benefit all users.
- The pgp-override changes will allow a new override to be implemented
- as-block changes only benefit RIPE NCC staff as only we can create these objects
