20100715 - version 3.8

Changes:
- mnt-by attribute is now mandatory in newly created or modified person and
role objects. This change means that all objects sent in for update have to
have one or more mnt-by attributes defined (unless it is a deletion).


Merged:
- feature-denis-mandatory_mnt_by


Installation notes:
- Since person/role and maintainer objects cross-reference each other, the 
only way for a new user to create their first pair of objects is by using a
separate helper tool, new-user-startup.cgi


Affected stakeholders:
- Anyone who tries to create person/role objects
- First-time users who try to create their first person and maintainer
- NCC Services WG
- DB WG
