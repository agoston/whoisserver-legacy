% -l <ip-lookup>   Returns first level less specific inetnum, 
%                  inet6num or route objects, excluding exact matches.
% -L <ip-lookup>   Returns all level less specific inetnum, 
%                  inet6num or route objects, including exact matches.
% -m <ip-lookup>   Returns first level more specific inetnum, 
%                  inet6num or route objects, excluding exact matches.
% -M <ip-lookup>   Returns all level more specific inetnum, 
%                  inet6num or route objects, excluding exact matches.
% -x <ip-lookup>   Requests that only an exact match on a prefix be
%                  performed.  If no exact match is found no objects are
%                  returned.
%
% -k (optional normal query) Requests a persistent connection. After
%                  returning the result the connection will not be closed by
%                  the server and a client may issue multiple queries on the
%                  same connection. 
%                  Note, that server implements 'stop-and-wait' protocol,
%                  when no next query can be sent before receiving a reply
%                  for the previous one.  Use RIPE whois3 client to be able
%                  to send queries in batch mode. 
%                  Except the first -k query, -k without an argument closes
%                  the persistent connection.  
% 
% -T (comma separated list of object types, no white space is allowed)
%                  Restricts the types of objects to lookup in the query.
% -a               Specifies that the server should perform lookups in all
%                  available sources.
% -s (comma separated list of sources, no white space is allowed) Specifies
%                  which sources and in which order are to be looked up when
%                  performing a query.
