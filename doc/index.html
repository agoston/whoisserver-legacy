<A NAME="#intro">
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Welcome to Version 3.0 of the RIPE Whois Database Software. This
version is completely different from the previous versions
of the software, i.e. v2.3.2 and below.

<P>
For instance, Version 3.0 of the Software uses <A HREF="#rpsl">RPSL</A>.
The old object syntax, based on 
<A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-181.html">RIPE-181</A>,
is not supported anymore, except that you can convert RIPE-181 objects
to store them in the database in RPSL format.
Check out the <A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/ripencc/pub-services/db/rpsl/">
RIPE-181 to RPSL migration page</A> that the RIPE NCC has prepared 
to ease your transition from RIPE-181 to RPSL.

<P>
Furthermore, the whole Whois database software has been completely
rewritten. It now stores the objects in a SQL backend instead than
in flat files, thus making it more scalable. Many new features
have been added, such as:

<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>Dynamic access control and authorization
<LI>Loading in memory the primary keys of certain types of objects
(the so-called <EM>radix tree</EM>)
<LI>A runtime administrative interface 
<LI>The parsing of MIME messages for database updates
</UL>

to name just a few.

<P>
The languages used in v3.0 are C/C++ (PERL was used in v2).


<A NAME="compiling">
<H3>Compiling and Installing the Package</H3>

<P>
For detailed instructions about compiling and installing the RIPE
Whois Database Software, please read the files <A HREF="../README">README</A>
and <A HREF="../INSTALL">INSTALL</A>, provided with this distribution.


<P>
The software is being developed and tested in the Solaris environment.
We managed to make it run on Solaris 2.6, 7 and 8 for SPARC, and on
Solaris 7 for Intel. More effort will be spent on portability in the
next few months.


<A NAME="docs">
<H3>Documentation</H3>

<P>
This package includes for you to read some 
<A HREF="../design/specs/README.html">design specifications</A>;
you can also <A HREF="global/index.html">browse</A> through our source code
or <A HREF="cxref/index.html">view</A> the source files commented using 
CXREF style.

<P>
In the not-so-far future, we will include more documentation as to how
the RIPE Whois Database Software v3.0 works, and some manpages.


<A NAME="transition">
<H3>The transition from RIPE Database v2 to v3</H3>

<P>
At a certain point in future, the RIPE Database will switch to RPSL format,
and abandon the RIPE-181 format. This will not happen in a sudden way,
however. There is a transition plan, described in a "Transition" document
that you can find linked 
<A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/ripencc/pub-services/db/rpsl/">here</A>.

<P>
Please check the 
<A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/ripencc/pub-services/db/rpsl/transition-v3.pdf">transition</A>
document for the various phases and timelines of the transition.  The
transition date for the RIPE Whois server is 23 April 2001.


<A NAME="rpsl">
<H3>RPSL</H3>

<P>
RPSL is an acronym for <EM>Routing Policy Specification Language</EM>. 
Its specifications are defined
in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ripe.net/rfc/rfc2622.txt">RFC2622</A>. You can also
check <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ripe.net/rfc/rfc2650.txt">RFC2650</A>,
"Using RPSL in Practice",
and a <A HREF="http://www.ripe.net/ripe/meetings/archive/ripe-33/presentations/rpsl-tutorial/">tutorial</A>
on RPSL given by the RIPE NCC Database group.
