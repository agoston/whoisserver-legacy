FINE-TUNING MYSQL
-----------------

* Whois software allows arbitrarily large BLOBs to be created. There are
  some entries that exceed the default packet size of Mysql. Default
  settings will also cause the server to crash while mirroring RIPE
  database. Inserting the following to [mysqld] section of my.cnf will
  solve the problem:

  set-variable = max_allowed_packet=10M

  which assumes that the largest object is ~10M.

* Whois software maintains a persistent connection to Mysql server. If the
  whois server stands idle for a long time, connection is dropped by Mysql.
  There are also certain cases where mysql just decides to drop the
  connection due to large number of errors. Inserting the following lines
  will solve problems about whois to mysql connections:

  set-variable = wait_timeout=31536000
  set-variable = max_connect_errors=999999999
  set-variable = max_connections=1000
  set-variable = back_log=200
  set-variable = connect_timeout=20
  set-variable = net_read_timeout=60
  set-variable = net_retry_count=20
  set-variable = net_write_timeout=120
  set-variable = key_buffer_size=64M
  set-variable = table_cache=256
  set-variable = sort_buffer=4M
  set-variable = record_buffer=1M
