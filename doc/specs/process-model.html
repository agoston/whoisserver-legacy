<H2>Processes</H2>

<DL>
<DT><B>dbd (whois_rip)</B>
	<DD><P>The "master" daemon of the database system. All access
	to the underlying database engine goes through this process. 
	It is implemented as a multi-threaded process,
	and written in C. 
	<BR>The dbd daemon:</P>

	<P>
	<UL>
	<LI>answers to queries made with whois; 
	<LI>receives update requests from dbupdate and the networkupdate
		daemon with the update protocol 
		(single-object updates);
	<LI>does referral integrity checks for the updates;
	<LI>keeps in-memory the primary keys of routes, inetnums,
		in-addr.arpa domains to answer specific queries
		very efficiently;
	<LI>takes care of locking issues which are not handled by the
		underlying database automatically;
	<LI>is the only "clean" entry-point to the underlying storage
		system;
	<LI>answers to near-real-time mirrors on a specific port
		(different than port 43), supplying them with
		serials;
	<LI>has a special "admin port", to which the administrators
		can connect (with telnet) and change some configuration
		parameters on-the-fly.
	</UL>
	</P>

<DT><B>dbupdate</B>
	<DD><P>The front-end process for incoming updates. It starts
	from <TT>.forward</TT>: the incoming update mail messages are
	piped to dbupdate. It can also be invoked from command-line,
	using a file as an argument. It is written in C, and C++ for the
	object parser. 
	<BR>The dbupdate process:</P>

	<P>
	<UL>
	<LI>parses the headers of incoming mail and extracts the
		relevant bits of information (like the <I>from</I> 
		address)
	<LI>does MIME decoding if needed;
	<LI>decodes PGP parts and verifies signatures if needed;
	<LI>parses the objects, verifies the syntax and reports syntax
		errors;
	<LI>passes the objects to dbd with authentication information
		with the update protocol, i.e. sending one object
		at a time with the ADD, DEL or UPD instruction;
	<LI>sends acknowledgements and notifications.
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
        Must pay extra attention in using the right exit codes
        (should probably return 75 for ALL fatal errors and other
        non-successful situations and report them to the database
        management through some channel instead of sending ugly
        bounces to senders).</P>



<DT><B>networkupdate</B>
	<DD><P>A dumb program which just reads an update from STDIN
	and sends it to the networkupdate daemon. Written in Perl.</P>

<DT><B>networkupdate daemon</B>
	<DD><P>Started from inetd every time an update is sent from
	networkupdate. It is actually the same binary as dbupdate,
        invoked with a flag (namely, -n).
